This repository will have the uploads of each successive version of the file in binary and executable format.
The versions here will be the modded versions and will have one more mode than the previous and will create a
sort of timeline as versions are uploaded. This README will be used to explain what each version that is
uploaded has that the previous does not.

-Tana1983.exe && Tana1983.bin

The original file with glitches and all.

-Tana1983fix.exe && Tana1983fix.bin

This file does not contain any modifications and will act as the basis for the working versions. The only
changes here are the containment of the malicious code inside which allows the file to be ran safely with
no worries regarding the previous problems with the code.

-REPORT.docx

The final report, with edits intended to help with grammar and readers understanding. An explanation of how
the problem was approached along with the specifications for each mod is listed along with links to Sam
Hobbs' repository where the main files have mostly been uploaded.

-Tana1983(1.5.0).exe

Basis for final executable file. Contains snake head change, speed consistency, and score
based speed mods.

-Tana1983(1.5.10).exe

Final version of the executable. Along with previous mods, the game now contains a wall change mod which
turns the walls from W to JO. The changes include the base speed has been increased, visual bugs regarding
the wall and snake head have been fixed, and an easter egg involving a reskin of the original malicious line
has been implimented.
