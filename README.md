This repository will have the uploads of each successive version of the file in binary and executable format.
The versions here will be the modded versions and will have one more mode than the previous and will create a
sort of timeline as versions are uploaded. This README will be used to explain what each version that is
uploaded has that the previous does not.

-Tana1983.exe && Tana1983.bin

The original file with glitches and all.

-Tana1983fix.exe && Tana1983fix.bin

This file does not contain any modifications and will act as the basis for the working versions. The only
changes here are the containment of the malicious code inside which allows the file to be ran safely with
no worries regarding the previous problems with the code.
